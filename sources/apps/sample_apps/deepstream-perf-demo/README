You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

This demo shows the performance of deepstream, like flowers classification
by TensorRT inference server in GTC show and the difference is that images input
is changed to video input. Please check the below link:

Pipeline:
filesrc (switch)-> h264parser -> nvv4l2decoder -> nvstreammux -> pgie -> sgie1
-> sgie2-> sgie3 -> nvvideoconvert -> nvdsosd -> (nvtransform) ->nveglglessink


Usage and compilation steps:
- Prepare a folder and put all h264 files in it
- $ Set CUDA_VER in the MakeFile as per platform.
      For Jetson, CUDA_VER=10.2
      For x86, CUDA_VER=11.4
-  $ sudo make

To run:
- $ ./deepstream-perf-demo <rows num> <columns num> <streams dir>
    Note: It's better rows == columns

NOTE: To compile the sources, run make with "sudo" or root permission.
