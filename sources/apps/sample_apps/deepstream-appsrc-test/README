Prequisites:

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
    GStreamer-1.0
    GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
    GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
    X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

Creating raw video streams from Encoded streams:
Raw streams can be created using gst-launch-1.0. The pipeline is as follows:
  $ gst-launch-1.0 uridecodebin uri=<URI of file> ! nvvideoconvert !
      'video/x-raw, format=<Format of stream (example: I420, NV12, RGBA)>,
      width=<Width of stream>, height=<height of stream>' ! filesink location=test.raw
Example pipeline:
  $ gst-launch-1.0 uridecodebin \
      uri=file:///opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.0/samples/streams/sample_720p.mp4 \
      ! nvvideoconvert ! 'video/x-raw, format=I420, width=1280, height=720' \
      ! filesink location=test.i420

Compilation Steps:

  $ Set CUDA_VER in the MakeFile as per platform.
      For Jetson, CUDA_VER=10.2
      For x86, CUDA_VER=11.4
  $ sudo make

To run:
  $ ./deepstream-appsrc-test <Raw video stream (example: YUV)> <width of stream>
      <height of stream> <expected FPS of stream> <format of stream (example: I420, NV12, RGBA)>

NOTE: To compile the sources, run make with "sudo" or root permission.

This document shall describe about the sample deepstream-appsrc-test application.

It is meant to demonstrate how raw video frames acquired from outside DeepStream
can be fed to a DeepStream pipeline. It also demostrates how metadata can be accessed
via appsink and used outside deepstream.

This sample uses appsrc APIs to push raw video frames read using fread () onto appsrc
component. From appsrc, the usual deepstream components are then used. We use single primary
inferencing here. Then the buffers are sent via a tee to regular video rendering sink and
appsink. Appsink extracts buffer from sample and then obtaines metadata information from it.

NOTE: This app supports only RGBA, NV12 and I420 raw video streams.
